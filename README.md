# GCHQBot `20.2.dev`
Private bot for a private server, spying and protecting since 1919.

`20.2.dev` relies on as of yet unreleased additions to 
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/).
These changes allow for voice latency monitoring and will be used
in a new guild stability monitoring `cog`.

This bot is not meant as an example for programming best practices, it's a
hobby project used to escape the rigmarole of documenting everything properly.
It probably won't work if you try to use it, as it has been built for use on a
specific Discord Guild.

Automated vote closing is currently bugged, many automated tasks are also
bugged, these will be fixed over the course of the next few months.
