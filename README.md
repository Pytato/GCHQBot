# TempleBot `2.0.0a`
Private bot for a private server, spying and protecting since 1919.

`2.0.0a` is a rewrite of the old bot to make it docker compatible, more modular
and easier to maintain remotely. The implementation with docker will permit 
[Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower "Watchtower Github")'s
seamless updating for the bot.
