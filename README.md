# GCHQBot
Private bot for a private server, spying and protecting since 1919.

This bot is not meant as an example for programming best practices, it's a hobby project used to escape the rigmarole of documenting everything properly. It probably won't work if you try to use it, as it has been built for use on a specific Discord Guild.

Automated vote closing is currently bugged, many automated tasks are also bugged, these will be fixed over
the course of the next few months.
